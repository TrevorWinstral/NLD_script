abstract = {We prove analytic criteria for the existence of finite-time attracting and repelling material surfaces and lines in three-dimensional unsteady flows. The longest lived such structures define coherent structures in a Lagrangian sense. Our existence criteria involve the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor along fluid trajectories. An alternative approach to coherent structures is shown to lead to their characterization as local maximizers of the largest finite-time Lyapunov exponent field computed directly from particle paths. Both approaches provide effective tools for extracting distinguished Lagrangian structures from three-dimensional velocity data. We illustrate the results on steady and unsteady ABC-type flows.}

abstract = {The present work is dedicated to the detection of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) in viscous flows through the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs) which have been addressed by several works in the recent literature. Here, a novel numerical technique is presented in the context of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) models. Thanks to the Lagrangian character of SPH, the trajectory of each fluid particle is explicitly tracked over the whole simulation. This allows for a direct evaluation of the FTLE field supplying a new way for the data analysis of complex flows. The evaluation of FTLE can be either implemented as a post-processing or nested into the SPH scheme conveniently. In the numerical results, three test-cases are presented giving a proof of concept for different conditions. The last test-case regards a naval engineering problem for which the present algorithm is successfully used to capture the submerged vortical tunnels caused by the splashing bow wave.}

abstract={FOR a long time methods analogous to those of statistical mechanics have been applied to animal and plant communities. But just as in physical chemistry these methods soon become intolerably cumbrous and may generally be replaced by thermodynamical calculations which ignore the individual molecule, so in the book before us the author has applied to biological problems a treatment of the type familiar in chemical statics and kinetics. These methods are applied to the growth of populations, whether of bacteria, insects, men,. or railway engines, and to relationships between different species, for example, between a parasite and one or more hosts. The author has the problem of evolution always before him, and considers analytically the effect on population of a change in the behaviour of individuals.},
