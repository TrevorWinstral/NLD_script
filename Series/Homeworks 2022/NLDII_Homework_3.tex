\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a linearized Hamiltonian
system, then so is $-\lambda$. (\emph{Hint:} For any symmetric matrix
$A$ and any nonsingular matrix $B$, the eigenvalues of $BA$ and
$B^{-1}\left(BA\right)B$ coincide.)
\item A \emph{gradient system} is a dynamical system of the form 
\[
\dot{x}=-DV(x),\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},
\]
with some smooth function $V$. Apart from the absence of the symplectic
matrix $J$, gradient systems appear similar to Hamiltonian systems.
In fact, they are rather different, as the following exercises show.

(a) Show that the eigenvalues of a linearized gradient system are
always real.

(b) Find a condition for $V$ under which a fixed point of a gradient
system is asymptotically stable.

(c) Show that gradient systems cannot have periodic orbits.

(d) Given a smooth function $f\left(x\right)$, propose a numerical
method for finding the local minima and maxima of $f$.
\item Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a smooth function, where $X\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$
is a manifold. Prove that the graph of $f$,
\[
\mathrm{graph}(f)=\left\{ (x,y)\in X\times Y:\,\,\,y=f(x)\right\} 
\]
is always a manifold.
\item Show that the tangent space of a manifold at any point is independent
of the local parametrization used in its construction (i.e., another
local parametrization would give the same tangent space).
\item Prove that the tangent bundle of a manifold is a manifold by constructing
an explicit local parametrization.
